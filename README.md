# Real-Time Bus Tracking Map-Animation
The JavaScript code creates an animated marker on a Mapbox map, which moves through a series of predetermined coordinates (representing bus stops between MIT and Harvard) every second, visualizing a bus route.

How to run:
Download the files locally, ensure all files are in the same folder, then simply open the index.html file with any web browser. To initiate the demonstration, select the button at the top left corner "Show stops between MIT and Harvard". If you'd like to reset, simply refresh the page.

Future Improvements:
Automate initiation and looping feature to easily show all stops. Possibly adding smaller icons for every stop that grow large as the animation demonstrates each position.
